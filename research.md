## Research Themes
We conduct research on two directions.

### Computational and AI tools for architecture and design
Investigating practical and theoretical implications of computational tools and AI on design processes.

### Digital fabrication usong natural materials
Architecture and design are among the industries with the hhighest environmental impact - from energy and material use and CO2 and from the point of view of other emissions (i.e. methane). 
Developing new materials that biodegrade faster, that are grown instead of mined can help alleviate the environmental impact of designed products and buildings.
