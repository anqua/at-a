## Research Themes

### Computational tools and AI for architecture and design
Short paragraph describing the problem, approach, and significance.

### Digital fabrication usong natural materials
Architecture and design are among the industries with the hhighest environmental impact - from energy and material use and CO2 and from the point of view of other emissions (i.e. methane). 
Developing new materials that biodegrade faster, that are grown instead of mined can help alleviate the environmental impact of designed products and buildings.
