## Research Themes
We conduct research on the following directions: computational tools including AI for design and archietcture and digital fabrication using natural materials for design and architecture in the context of design for sustainability.

We publish across the following fields: architecture&design, human-computer interaction, media art
We also exhibit design and artworks in various venues.

### Computational and AI tools for architecture and design
Investigating practical and theoretical implications of computational tools and AI on design processes. 
We ask questions such as: how does computation and AI change thinking and creative processes - what and how do we think using computation? What is there to gain and what is to lose from the on-going retooling of these creative professions?


### Digital fabrication usong natural materials
Architecture and design are among the industries with the hhighest environmental impact - energy and material use, and CO2 as well as other emissions (i.e. methane).
Developing new materials that biodegrade faster, that are grown instead of mined can help alleviate the environmental impact of designed products and buildings.

Research methods: design-based research, material-based research, art-based research
